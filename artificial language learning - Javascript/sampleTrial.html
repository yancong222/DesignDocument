<div style="width: 40em;">
  <p>Thank you for your participation.</p>

  <p>Suppose you are on Mars, and in order to communicte with aliens, you will learn their language.
    You will learn by feedback.
    You will see displays with fake words.
    They are used for describing colors and shapes, which are illustrated by the images.</p>
    
  <p>Below are the two groups of words and images.
    Your task is to guess the meaning and to decide which image the word refers to, and sometimes to decide which word the image corresponds to.</p>


  <p><b>Example 1: color word <mark>"bosa". It can be USED BY ITSELF to refer to a colored shape.</mark></b></p>
 
  <h1 class="yes-group"><p><mark>bosa</mark></p></h1>
  <div class="vertical-box">
    <ul>
      <li><span class="object" style="color: brown">&#9829;</span>
  <p>A</p></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="vertical-box">
    <ul>
      <li><span class="object" style="color: black">&#9829;</span>
  <p>B</p></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="vertical-box">
    <ul>
      <li><span class="object" style="color: orange">&#9829;</span>
  <p>C</p></li>
    </ul>
  </div>  
   <div class="clear-both"></div> <!-- add an empty sep -->

<p><b>For this example, suppose <mark>"bosa"</mark> means black, when you choose B, you receive feedback "Correct".</b></p>

  <div class="clear-both"></div> <!-- add an empty sep -->

  <p><b>Example 2: color word <mark>"gaddle"</mark>. It HAS TO BE USED WITH THE SHAPES. Now suppose you know <mark>"smick"</mark> means &#9651</b></p>

  <h1 class="yes-group"><p><mark>gaddle smick</mark></p></h1>
  <div class="vertical-box">
    <ul>
      <li><span class="object" style="color: grey">&#9650;</span>
  <p>A</p></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  
  <div class="vertical-box">
    <ul>
      <li><span class="object" style="color: purple">&#9650;</span>
  <p>B</p></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="vertical-box">
    <ul>
      <li><span class="object" style="color: pink">&#9650;</span>
  <p>C</p></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    
   <div class="clear-both"></div> <!-- add an empty sep -->

    
  <p><b>For this example, suppose <mark>"gaddle"</mark> means pink, then <mark>"gaddle smick"</mark> would refer to C. When you choose C, you receive feedback "Correct".</b></p>

  
  <div class="clear-both"></div> <!-- add an empty sep -->

  <p>For the first part of the experiment (learning), you will receive prompts "Correct"/"Incorrect".
  For the second part, you will be tested on the words you have learned (testing). You will not receive any feedback.</p>
  

  <div class="clear-both"></div>
  
  <p>Sometimes, the task will seem very easy. Sometimes, it will seem trickier if not entirely arbitrary.
    This is not an IQ test and there may not always be a proper, unambiguous answer.
    What matters the most to us is that you follow your instinct and report your intuition,
    especially in these cases where it seems that you have to guess.</p>
